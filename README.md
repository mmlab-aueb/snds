## About
This is the github repository of the **Secure Named Data Sharing (SNDS)** project.
SNDS is set to revolutionize the Named-Data Networking (NDN) Information-Centric Networking (ICN) architecture by introducing extensions tailored for query-based content retrieval, fine-grained storage, and content updates -- creating an optimal foundation for a Content Delivery Network (CDN) underlay.
For more information about the project, visit the project's [homepage](https://mm.aueb.gr/projects/snds). 

This project is funded by [NGI SARGASSO](https://www.ngi.eu/ngi-projects/ngi-sargasso/).
